## timeComplexity.m ##

This script demonstrates how to measure the execution time of a loop in MATLAB using tic and toc.

1 - 0.000467seconds

10 - 0.001018seconds

100 - 0.003490seconds

1000 - 0.037594seconds


## lenearSearch.m ##
Search for a specific value (index = 9) in the array a = [3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 13] using a linear search, and print its position if found.

## lenearSearchTime.m ##

This MATLAB code performs a linear search to find the value 9 in the array a = [3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 13].

It uses a for loop to check each element.

If the value is found, it:

Sets found = true

Updates index to the position (1-based)

Breaks the loop

After the search, it prints the index if found or "not found" otherwise.

tic and toc measure the time taken for the search.
